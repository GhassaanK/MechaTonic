A 2nd semester OOP project built using Java Swing. It is an online mechanic appointment desktop application having three interfaces for Users, Admins, and Mechanics. It has a Main Screen having two main options Admin Login and User Login and a logo. Admin Login screen has a form that has a form validation to accept "admin" and "admin" as username and password. It also checks if the form is empty and produces an error on submission. The same is done with the User Login screen to accept the "user@demo.com" as email and "password" as password. Further logging into the user account, will redirect to the user dashboard which has a side panel having different options for the user. The main dashboard consists of three service components named "Bike", "Car", and "HTV". Clicking on any of them will redirect the user to the next screen consisting of forms for submitting details of the vehicle.
